Caesar Cipher - Simple Encryption & Decryption

This project demonstrates the Caesar Cipher, a basic encryption technique where each letter in the text is shifted by a fixed number of positions in the alphabet.

🔹 Features
✅ Encrypts plaintext using a shift key
✅ Decrypts ciphertext back to original text
✅ Works with both uppercase and lowercase letters
✅ Keeps special characters unchanged

📌 How It Works

Each letter in the text is shifted forward (encryption) or backward (decryption) based on the key.
The shift wraps around within the 26 English letters (A-Z, a-z).
Non-alphabet characters remain unchanged.

🚀 Quick Start Prerequisites

Python 3.x
Jupyter Notebook (or Google Colab)

Run the Code 
1️⃣ Clone the Repository

git clone https://github.com/your-username/Caesar-Cipher.git
cd Caesar-Cipher
2️⃣ Open Jupyter Notebook & Run
3️⃣ Input Text & Key
Enter the text to encrypt: hello
Enter the key: 3
Cipher text: khoor

4️⃣ Decrypt the Text
Enter the cipher text: khoor
Enter the key: 3
Plain text: hello

🎯 Examples
🔹 Encryption
Plaintext	Key	Ciphertext
hello	3	khoor
python	5	udymts
🔹 Decryption
Ciphertext	Key	Plaintext
khoor	3	hello
udymts	5	python
