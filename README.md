Caesar Cipher - Simple Encryption & Decryption

This project demonstrates the Caesar Cipher, a basic encryption technique where each letter in the text is shifted by a fixed number of positions in the alphabet.

üîπ Features
‚úÖ Encrypts plaintext using a shift key

‚úÖ Decrypts ciphertext back to original text

‚úÖ Works with both uppercase and lowercase letters

‚úÖ Keeps special characters unchanged

üìå How It Works

Each letter in the text is shifted forward (encryption) or backward (decryption) based on the key.
The shift wraps around within the 26 English letters (A-Z, a-z).
Non-alphabet characters remain unchanged.

Hill Cipher Encryption in Python
This is a simple implementation of the Hill Cipher encryption algorithm using NumPy.

How It Works
The program encrypts a given plaintext using matrix multiplication.
It converts characters to numerical values (A=0, B=1, ..., Z=25).
If the plaintext length is not a multiple of the key matrix size, it is padded with X.
The encryption is performed using modular arithmetic with matrix multiplication.
The encrypted text is then converted back to letters.

Prerequisites
Make sure you have Python installed with the following package:
pip install numpy

Usage
Run the script and enter the plaintext to encrypt.

Example

Input:  HELLO

Output: ZEBBWX

Notes
The key matrix should be invertible modulo 26 for decryption.
The script currently only supports encryption.
Ensure that the key matrix is square (n √ó n).



Monoalphabetic-Cipher
A simple and user-friendly implementation of the Monoalphabetic Cipher in Python for encryption and decryption of messages using a fixed substitution alphabet.
Introduction
The Monoalphabetic Cipher is a type of substitution cipher where each letter in the plaintext is replaced with a corresponding letter from a predefined mapping. This implementation provides an easy-to-use interface for encrypting and decrypting messages.

Features
‚úÖ Encrypts plaintext messages using a predefined substitution alphabet.

‚úÖ Decrypts ciphertext messages back to the original plaintext.

‚úÖ Preserves non-alphabetic characters without modification.

‚úÖ Simple and easy-to-use Python script.

How It Works
The script defines two mappings:

p = 'abcdefghijklmnopqrstuvwxyz' (Plaintext alphabet)

ch = 'QWERTYUIOPASDFGHJKLZXCVBNM' (Ciphertext alphabet)

Each letter from the input is replaced with its corresponding letter from the predefined mapping during encryption, and vice versa during decryption.


Playfair-Cipher

A Python implementation of the Playfair Cipher for encrypting and decrypting text using a key-based 5x5 matrix

Introduction
The Playfair Cipher is a digraph substitution cipher that encrypts pairs of letters in plaintext using a 5x5 key matrix. It replaces repeating letters and adjusts odd-length messages by adding filler characters.

Features
‚úÖ Encrypts text using a Playfair matrix.

‚úÖ Decrypts ciphertext back to its original plaintext.

‚úÖ Handles odd-length plaintext by appending an 'X'.

‚úÖ Ignores spaces and treats 'J' as 'I'.

‚úÖ Simple Python implementation with easy-to-follow logic.

How It Works
Matrix Creation: A 5x5 matrix is generated using the key.
Position Finding: Each letter's position is determined in the matrix.
Encryption: Letters in the same row/column shift accordingly; otherwise, a rectangle swap is performed.
Decryption: Reverse of encryption logic 

Example
$ python playfair_cipher.py

Enter the plain text: instruments

Enter the key: monarchy

Encrypted message: GATLMZCLRQXA

Enter the cipher text: gatlmzclrqxa

Enter the key: monarchy

Decrypted message: INSTRUMENTSX
